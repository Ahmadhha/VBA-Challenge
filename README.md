# VBA-Challenge
 Multi-year Stock Data Analysis

This VBA Script runs on multiple worksheets to analyze the open and close positions on the start and end of the year and returns the yearly change value and percentage as well as the total volume for each ticker.

The greatest increase, decrease, and total volume traded across all tickers is also returned for each year.

To ensure the code runs on all worksheets, use the Worksheet_loop() script.
